# Neural Networks Explained: Beyond the Black Box

Neural networks have transformed AI, but they're often treated as mysterious black boxes. Let's demystify how they actually work and make decisions.

## The Building Blocks

At their core, neural networks consist of:
- **Neurons**: Simple computational units
- **Connections**: Weighted pathways between neurons
- **Layers**: Organized groups of neurons

## How Neural Networks Learn

The learning process involves:
1. **Forward Propagation**: Input data flows through the network
2. **Error Calculation**: Comparing output with expected results
3. **Backpropagation**: Adjusting weights to reduce errors
4. **Iteration**: Repeating until performance improves

## Common Neural Network Types

Different architectures serve different purposes:
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Excel at image processing
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Handle sequential data
- **Transformer Networks**: Power modern language models

## Interpreting Neural Networks

Understanding what happens inside involves:
- **Activation Visualization**: Seeing what neurons respond to
- **Feature Attribution**: Identifying important input features
- **Concept Vectors**: Mapping internal representations to human concepts

## The Future of Neural Network Explainability

As we continue to advance, we're developing:
- Better visualization techniques
- More mathematically rigorous explanations
- Inherently interpretable network architectures

By understanding neural networks beyond their black box reputation, we can build more trustworthy, debuggable, and ultimately more useful AI systems.
